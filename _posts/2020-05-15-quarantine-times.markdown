After quite some time without publishing anything here, I decided to share the
latest events. It is a hard time for most of us but with all this time at home,
one can also do great things.

I would like to start with the wonderful idea the Debian Brasil community had!
Why not create an online Debian related conference to keep people's minds busy
and also share knowledge? After brainstorming, we came up with our online
conference called [\#FiqueEmCasaUseDebian](http://live.debianbrasil.org.br/)
(in English it would be \#StayHomeUseDebian). It started on May 3rd and will
last until May 30th (yes, one month)! Every weekday, we have one online talk at
night and on every Saturday, a Debian packaging workshop. The feedback so far
has been awesome and the Brazilian Debian community is reaching out to more
people than usual at our regular conferences (as you might have imagined,
Brazil is huge and it is hard to bring people at the same place). At the end of
the month, we will have the first [MiniDebConf
online](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEvents/internet/2020/MiniDebConfOnline)
and I hope it will be as successful as our experience here in Brazil.

Another thing that deserves a highlight is the fact that I became an Ubuntu
Core Developer this month; yay! After 9 months of working almost daily on the
Ubuntu Server, I was able to get my upload rights to the Ubuntu archive. I was
tired of asking for sponsorship, and probably my peers were tired of me too.

I could spend more time here complaining about the Brazilian government but I
think it isn't worth it. Let's try to do something useful instead!
