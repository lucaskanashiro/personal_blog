From August 6 to August 12 I attended the
[DebConf17](https://debconf17.debconf.org/), as always was an awesome
conference. That was my first time in Canada, it is a nice place. The most
famous typical food in Montreal is [poutine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poutine),
and I ate it a lot! This is not too much different from a portion of fries here
in Brazil.

From a Debian point of view the conference was very fruitful. I think that
this was the DebConf that I watched more talks, the schedule was amazing.
The DebConf just started with an incredible talk:
"[Delivering Software for Memory Driven Computing](https://debconf17.debconf.org/talks/206/)"
by [Keith Packard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Packard). This guy is a
well known X Window System developer and brought many thoughts about the
memory driven computing, I am not an expert in this area but it was very nice!
I want to emphasize the Enrico's talk titled
"[Consensually doing things together?](https://debconf17.debconf.org/talks/92/)".
He gracefully introduced us an important theme in the Debian context,
people must not do things that they do not want to do, if it is important
other people will show up and take care of it.

I really liked many talks, mostly the ones related to [flatpak](http://flatpak.org/).
In the future I intend to help on this stuff in Debian, I think it will solve
many issues related with desktop applications.

During the DebConf I recorded a [Papo Livre](https://papolivre.org/6/) episode
with Antonio Terceiro and Samuel Henrique. Papo livre is a Brazilian podcast
that intends to discuss things about free software in portuguese. We talked
about how we start to contribute with Debian, what we actually do in Debian,
the DebConf's experiences and how interested people can start their
contributions. It was so funny! :-)

In short, It was a nice experience and I had great times during this DebConf.
I am looking forward to the next DebConf in Taiwan, I expect to attend it. Also
we are preparing the [Brazilian BID](https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf18/Bids/Curitiba)
to run for the DebConf19, I hope see you in Curitiba!
