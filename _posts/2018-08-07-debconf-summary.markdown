Come as no surprise, Debcamp and Debconf 18 were amazing! I worked on many
things that I had not had enough time to accomplish before; also I had the
opportunity to meet old friends and new people. Finally, I engaged in important
discussions regarding the Debian project.

Based on [my last blog
post](http://blog.kanashiro.xyz/debian/debcamp/debconf/2018/07/19/debcamp-plans.html),
follows what I did in Hsinchu during these days.

- The [Debconf 19 website](https://debconf19.debconf.org/) has an initial
version running \o/ I want to thank Valessio Brito and Arthur Del Esposte for
helping me build this first version, and also thank tumblingweed for your
explanation about how [wafer](https://github.com/CTPUG/wafer) works.

- The Perl Team Rolling Sprint was really nice! Four people participated, and
we were able to get a bunch of things done, you can see the full report
[here](https://perl-team.pages.debian.net/docs/sprint-debcamp2018/report-debcamp2018.html).

- Arthur Del Esposte (my GSoC intern) made some improvements on his work,
and also collected some feedbacks from others developers. I hope he will blog
post these things soon. You can find his presentation about his GSoC project
[here](https://ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/debian-meetings/2018/DebConf18/2018-07-31/gsoc-session.webm);
he is the first student in the video :)

- I worked on some Ruby packages. I uploaded some new dependencies of
Rails 5 to unstable (which Praveen et al. were already working on them). I hope
we can make Rails 5 package available in experimental soon, and ship it in the
next Debian stable release. I also discussed about Redmine package with Duck
(Redmine's co-maintainer) but did not manage to work on it.

Besides the technical part, this was my first time in Asia! I loved the
architecture, despite the tight streets, the night markets the temples and so
on. Some pictures that I took below:

And in order to provide a great experience for the Debian community next year
in Curitiba - Brazil, we already started to prepare the ground for you :)
