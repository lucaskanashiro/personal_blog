This is the Lucas Kanashiro's personal blog. The ideia is to document and share
any experience related to software development, mostly about Free Software
world.

I am a Debian and Ubuntu developer and a Free Software enthusiast. In the
academic area I have a master degree on Computer Science at Universidade de São
Paulo ([IME](https://www.ime.usp.br/dcc)) since 2019, and I received my
Bachelor's in 2015 from the Universidade de Brasília
([FGA](https://fga.unb.br/software)) where I majored in Software Engineering.

You can check my [Github](https://github.com/lucaskanashiro/) and
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-kanashiro-076821ba/) here.
Have fun!
