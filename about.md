This is the Lucas Kanashiro's personal blog. The ideia is to document and share
any experience related to software development, mostly about Free Software
world.

Currently, I am a Computer Science Master student at Universidade de São Paulo
([IME](https://www.ime.usp.br/dcc)). I received my Bachelor's in 2015 from the
Universidade de Brasília ([FGA](https://fga.unb.br/software)) where I majored
in Software Engineering. Moreover, I am a Debian developer and a Free Software
enthusiast.

You can check my [Github](https://github.com/lucaskanashiro/) and
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-kanashiro-076821ba/) here.

Have fun!
